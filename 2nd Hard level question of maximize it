# there is second question name maximize it 


solution of that is 

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

from itertools import product

K,M = map(int,input().split())
N = (list(map(int, input().split()))[1:] for _ in range(K))
results = map(lambda x: sum(i**2 for i in x)%M, product(*N))
print(max(results))
